# nntlib - a Neural Network Template Library
This library offers neural network templates for C++14. It is designed to be very flexible regarding to data formats and data storage.

## What's (not) Included
Currently, nntlib offers the following features:

### Network Design
The library implements the following design principles:

 - Flexible Templated Forward Neural Network
 - Choice of Data Types and Input Iterators
 - Ability to Preallocate Memory (e.g. for network state, error state and training deltas)

### Activation Functions
The following activation functions can be used:

 - Identity
 - Sigmoid
 - TanH

### Loss Functions
Depending on the learning task (e.g. classification), the following loss functions can be selected:
 - Mean Squared Error
 - Cross Entropy

### Layers
Multiple layer types enable different designs at compile time while layer sizes are set at runtime:
 - Fully Connected Layer
 - Dropout Layer

### Training
To archive good results, the following training methods can be used in combination with different methods to calculate learning rates depending on the number of rounds:
 - Stochastic Gradient Descent (optional: batch training, L2 regularization)
 - L-BFGS (optional: L2 regularization)

### Helpers
To make it easier to plug nntlib into existing architectures, some helpers are already implemented:
 - Iterator Adaptors (avoids copying of data, e.g. while training set generation)
 - ForEach for Multiple Iterators
 - Tuple Helpers (e.g. join, apply)

### TODO
The following features are missing:

 - Convolutional Layers (unlikely to get implemented because I don't need those)
 - More Training Methods
 - Multi-Threading
 - Tests
 - Serialization

## Requirements
To build and use nntlib, the following equipment is required:

 - C++14 compiler and stdlib
 - [Eigen 3 headers](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
 - Optional for docs: [cldoc](https://jessevdk.github.io/cldoc/)

## Usage
nntlib does not need to be precompiled because it is a header-only library. There are no link-time dependencies apart the C++14 standard library. See `examples` for some small programs. Because of the heavy usage of templates and very generic code it is recommended to active compiler optimization to get performant code.

To build the examples, use:

    make examples

To build the docs, use:

    make doc
